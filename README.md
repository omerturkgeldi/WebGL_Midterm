I have modeled the geometry of the initial letters of my name and surname, centered at the origin. Also with some input controls on which I implemented some functions, the user have the possibility to change the color of the first letter (the color of the second letter is the opposite color of the first letter), perform 2D displacement according to X and Y slider values and scale the size of the shapes according to the slider values.
